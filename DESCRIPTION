Description: Imputation for both missing covariates and censored observations (optional) for survival data with missing covariates by the nearest neighbor based multiple imputation algorithm as described in Hsu et al. (2006) <doi:10.1002/sim.2452>, and Hsu and Yu (2018) <doi: 10.1177/0962280218772592>. Note that the current version can only impute for a situation with one missing covariate.
